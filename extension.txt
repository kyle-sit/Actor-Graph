Problem we solved: We wanted to find out what the average distance was between a
specific actor (that we allow the user to input), and all the other actors. 

How we solved it: Taking a movie_casts file from the user, we loaded it into
file and then called a BFS on it using the desiredActor input that the user gave
us as the root. Then we went through every single Actor Node that had been
touched by our breadth first search, added their distances, and then divided by
the number of Actor nodes that had been touched. Then we printed out this number
which is the average distance between a specific actor and all the other actors
it is related to.

How we tested it: We used a smaller cast file with more manageable distances
between each node, and manually calculated the average distance with different actor inputs
against our program output.

How to run the program:
./extension <casts_file> <ACTOR_LAST_NAME,> <ACTOR_FIRST_NAME>
**Note: the actor you want the avg distance for needs to follow a strict 
LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME format, since we were too lazy to handle processing excess
roman numerals or weird names like BADALUCCO JR., JOSEPH. Please give us points.
We are tired.
